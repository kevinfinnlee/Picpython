One of the main uses of Pyrex is wrapping existing libraries of C code.
This is achieved by using <a href="#ExternDecls">external
declarations</a> to declare the C functions and variables from
the library that you want to use. <p>You can also use <a href="#PublicDecls">public declarations</a> to make C
functions and variables defined in a Pyrex module available to external
C code. The need for this is expected to be less frequent, but you
might want to do it, for example, if you are embedding Python in
another application as a scripting language. Just as a Pyrex module can
be used as a bridge to
allow Python code to call C code, it can also be used to allow C code
to
call Python code.</p><hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"> <h2> <a name="ExternDecls"></a>External
declarations</h2> By default, C functions and variables declared
at the module level are local to the module (i.e. they have the C <b>static</b>
storage class). They can also be declared <b>extern</b> to
specify that they are defined elsewhere, for example: <blockquote>
<pre>cdef extern int spam_counter</pre> <pre>cdef extern void order_spam(int tons)</pre></blockquote>
 <h3>
<a name="ReferencingHeaders"></a>Referencing C
header files</h3> When you use an extern definition on its own as
in the examples above, Pyrex includes a declaration for it in the
generated C file. This can cause problems if the declaration doesn't
exactly match the declaration that will be seen by other C code. If
you're wrapping an existing C library, for example, it's important that
the generated C code is compiled with exactly the same declarations as
the rest of the library. <p>To achieve this, you can tell Pyrex
that the declarations are to be found in a C header file, like this: </p>
<blockquote> <pre>cdef extern from "spam.h":</pre> <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int spam_counter</pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; void order_spam(int tons)</pre>
</blockquote> The <b>cdef extern from</b> clause
does three things: <ol><li> It directs Pyrex to place a <b>#include</b>
statement for the named header file in the generated C code.<br> </li>
&nbsp; <li> It prevents Pyrex from generating any C code for
the declarations found in the associated block.<br> </li>
&nbsp; <li> It treats all declarations within the block as
though they
started with <b>cdef extern</b>.</li></ol>
It's important to understand that Pyrex does <i>not</i>
itself read the C header file, so you still need to provide Pyrex
versions of any declarations from it that you use. However, the Pyrex
declarations don't always have to
exactly match the C ones, and in some cases they shouldn't or can't. In
particular: <ol><li> Don't use <b>const</b>.
Pyrex doesn't know anything about const,
so just leave it out. Most of the time this shouldn't cause any
problem,
although on rare occasions you might have to use a cast.<sup><a href="#Footnote1"> 1</a></sup><br> </li>
&nbsp; <li> Leave out any platform-specific extensions to C
declarations such as <b>__declspec()</b>.<br> </li>
&nbsp; <li> If the header file declares a big struct and you
only want
to use a few members, you only need to declare the members you're
interested in. Leaving the rest out doesn't do any harm, because the C
compiler will use the full definition from the header file.<br> <br>
In some cases, you might not need <i>any</i> of the
struct's members, in
which case you can just put <tt>pass</tt> in the body of
the struct declaration,
e.g.<br> <br> <tt>&nbsp; &nbsp; cdef extern
from "foo.h":<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
struct spam:<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; pass</tt><br> <br>
Note that you can only do this inside a <b>cdef extern from</b>
block; struct
declarations anywhere else must be non-empty.<br> <br> </li><li>
If the header file uses typedef names such as <b>size_t </b>to
refer to platform-dependent flavours of numeric types, you will need a
corresponding <b>ctypedef</b> statement, but you don't
need to match the type exactly, just use something of the right general
kind (int, float, etc). For example,</li><ol><pre>ctypedef int size_t</pre></ol>
will work okay whatever the actual size of a size_t is (provided the
header file defines it correctly). <br> &nbsp; <li>
If the header file uses macros to define constants, translate them into
a dummy <b>enum</b> declaration.<br> </li>
&nbsp; <li> If the header file defines a function using a
macro, declare it as though it were an ordinary function, with
appropriate argument and
result types.</li></ol> A few more tricks and tips: <ul><li>
If you want to include a C header because it's needed by another
header, but don't want to use any declarations from it, put <tt><font size="+1">pass</font></tt> in the extern-from
block:</li></ul> <ul><ul><tt>cdef extern
from "spam.h":</tt><br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
pass</tt></ul></ul> <ul><li> If you want
to include some external declarations, but don't want to specify a
header file (because it's included by some other header that you've
already included) you can put <tt>*</tt> in place of the
header file name:</li></ul> <blockquote> <blockquote><tt>cdef
extern from *:</tt> <br> <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
...</tt></blockquote> </blockquote> <h3> <a name="StructDeclStyles"></a>Styles of struct, union
and enum declaration</h3> There are two main ways that structs,
unions and enums can be declared in C header files: using a tag name,
or using a typedef. There are also some variations based on various
combinations of these. <p>It's important to make the Pyrex
declarations match the style used in the
header file, so that Pyrex can emit the right sort of references to the
type
in the code it generates. To make this possible, Pyrex provides two
different
syntaxes for declaring a struct, union or enum type. The style
introduced
above corresponds to the use of a tag name. To get the other style, you
prefix
the declaration with <b>ctypedef</b>, as illustrated
below. </p> <p>The following table shows the various
possible styles that can be found in a header file, and the
corresponding Pyrex declaration that you should put in the <b>cdef
exern from </b>block. Struct declarations are used as an
example; the same applies equally to union and enum declarations. </p>
<p>Note that in all the cases below, you refer to the type in
Pyrex code simply
as <tt><font size="+1">Foo</font></tt>,
not <tt><font size="+1">struct Foo</font></tt>.

<a name="AccessingAPI"></a>Accessing
Python/C API routines</h3> One particular use of the <b>cdef
extern from</b> statement is for gaining access to routines in
the Python/C API. For example, <blockquote> <pre>cdef extern from "Python.h":</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; object PyString_FromStringAndSize(char *s, Py_ssize_t len)</pre></blockquote>
will allow you to create Python strings containing
null bytes. <h3> <a name="SpecialTypes"></a>Special
Types</h3><p>Pyrex predefines the name <span style="font-family: monospace;">Py_ssize_t</span>
for use with Python/C API routines. To make your extensions compatible
with 64-bit systems, you should always use this type where it is
specified in the documentation of Python/C API routines.</p><h3><a name="CallingConventions"></a>Windows Calling
Conventions</h3><p>The <span style="font-family: monospace;">__stdcall</span>, <span style="font-family: monospace;">__fastcall</span> and <span style="font-family: monospace;">__cdecl</span> calling
convention specifiers can be used in Pyrex, with the same syntax as
used by C compilers on Windows, for example,</p><pre style="margin-left: 40px;">cdef extern int __stdcall FrobnicateWindow(long handle)<br><br>cdef void (__stdcall *callback)(void *)<br></pre>If
__stdcall is used, the function is only considered compatible with
other __stdcall functions of the same signature.<br><br> <hr width="100%"> <h2> <a name="CNameSpecs"></a>Resolving
naming conflicts - C name specifications</h2> Each Pyrex module
has a single module-level namespace for both Python
and C names. This can be inconvenient if you want to wrap some external
C functions and provide the Python user with Python functions of the
same
names. <p>Pyrex 0.8 provides a couple of different ways of
solving this problem. The best way, especially if you have many C
functions to wrap, is probably to put the extern C function
declarations into a different namespace using the facilities described
in the section on <a href="sharing.html">sharing
declarations between Pyrex modules</a>. </p> <p>The
other way is to use a <b>c name specification</b> to give
different Pyrex and C names to the C function. Suppose, for example,
that you want to wrap an external function called <tt>eject_tomato</tt>.
If you declare it as </p> <blockquote> <pre>cdef extern void c_eject_tomato "eject_tomato" (float speed)</pre>
</blockquote> then its name inside the Pyrex module will be <tt>c_eject_tomato</tt>,
whereas its name in C will be <tt>eject_tomato</tt>. You
can then wrap it with <blockquote> <pre>def eject_tomato(speed):<br>&nbsp; c_eject_tomato(speed)</pre>
</blockquote> so that users of your module can refer to it as <tt>eject_tomato</tt>.
<p>Another use for this feature is referring to external names
that happen to be Pyrex keywords. For example, if you want to call an
external function called <tt>print</tt>, you can rename it
to something else in your Pyrex module. </p> <p>As well
as functions, C names can be specified for variables, structs, unions,
enums, struct and union members, and enum values. For example, </p>
<blockquote> <pre>cdef extern int one "ein", two "zwei"<br>cdef extern float three "drei"<br><br>cdef struct spam "SPAM":<br>&nbsp; int i "eye"</pre><tt>cdef
enum surprise "inquisition":</tt> <br> <tt>&nbsp;
first "alpha"</tt> <br> <tt>&nbsp; second
"beta" = 3</tt></blockquote> <hr width="100%">
<h2><a name="Using_Pyrex_Declarations_from_C"></a>Using
Pyrex Declarations from C</h2>Pyrex
provides two methods for making C declarations from a Pyrex module
available for use by external C code &#8211; public declarations and C API
declarations.<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> You do <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> need to use
either of these to make declarations from one Pyrex module available to
another Pyrex module &#8211; you should use the <span style="font-weight: bold;">cimport</span> statement
for that. <a href="sharing.html">Sharing Declarations
Between Pyrex Modules</a>.</div><h3><a name="PublicDecls"></a>Public Declarations</h3>
You can make C types, variables and functions defined in a Pyrex module
accessible to C code that is linked with the module, by declaring them
with the <b><tt>public</tt></b> keyword: <blockquote><tt>cdef
public struct Bunny: # public type declaration<br>&nbsp;
&nbsp; int vorpalness<br><br>cdef public int spam #
public variable declaration</tt> <p><tt>cdef public
void grail(Bunny *): # public function declaration</tt> <br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</tt></p> </blockquote>
If there are any <tt>public</tt> declarations in a Pyrex
module, a header file called <b><span style="font-style: italic;">modulename</span>.h</b>
file is generated containing equivalent C declarations for inclusion in
other C code.<br><br>Any
C code wanting to make use of these declarations will need to be
linked, either statically or dynamically, with the extension module.<br><br>If
the Pyrex module resides within a package, then the name of the .h file
consists of the full dotted name of the module, e.g. a module called <span style="font-weight: bold;">foo.spam</span> would have
a header file called <span style="font-weight: bold;">foo.spam.h</span>.
<h3><a name="C_API_Declarations"></a>C API
Declarations</h3><p>The other way of making declarations available to C code is to declare them with the <span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;">api</span>
keyword. You can use this keyword with C functions and extension types. A header file called "<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;">modulename</span>_api.h</span>"
is produced containing declarations of the functions and extension types, and a function
called <span style="font-weight: bold;">import_<span style="font-style: italic;">modulename</span>()</span>.</p><p>C
code wanting to use these functions or extension types needs to include the header and call
the import_<span style="font-style: italic;">modulename</span>()
function. The other functions can then be called and the extension types used as usual.</p><p>Any
<span style="font-family: monospace;">public</span>
C type or extension type declarations in the Pyrex module are also made available when you
include <span style="font-style: italic;">modulename</span>_api.h.</p><table style="text-align: left; width: 100%;" border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td style="background-color: rgb(102, 204, 204);"><pre>delorean.pyx</pre></td><td style="background-color: rgb(255, 153, 0);"><pre>marty.c</pre></td></tr><tr><td style="vertical-align: top; background-color: rgb(102, 204, 204);"><pre>cdef public struct Vehicle:<br> int speed<br> float power<br><br>cdef api void activate(Vehicle *v):<br> if v.speed &gt;= 88 \<br> and v.power &gt;= 1.21:<br> print "Time travel achieved"</pre></td><td style="background-color: rgb(255, 153, 0);"><pre>#include "delorean_api.h"<br><br>Vehicle car;<br><br>int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {<br> import_delorean();<br> car.speed = atoi(argv[1]);<br> car.power = atof(argv[2]);&nbsp;<br> activate(&amp;car);<br>}</pre></td></tr></tbody></table><br>Note
that any types defined in the Pyrex module that are used as argument or
return types of the exported functions will need to be declared <span style="font-family: monospace;">public</span>,
otherwise they won't be included in the generated header file, and you
will get errors when you try to compile a C file that uses the header.<br><br>Using the <span style="font-family: monospace;">api</span> method does not require the C code using the declarations to be linked
with the extension module in any way, as the Python import machinery is
used to make the connection dynamically. However, only functions can be
accessed this way, not variables.<br><br>You can use both <span style="font-family: monospace;">public</span> and <span style="font-family: monospace;">api</span> on the same
function to make it available by both methods, e.g.<br><pre style="margin-left: 40px;">cdef public api void belt_and_braces():<br> ...<br></pre>However,
note that you should include <span style="font-weight: bold;">either</span>
<span style="font-style: italic;">modulename</span>.h
<span style="font-weight: bold;">or</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">modulename</span>_api.h in
a given C file, <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span>
both, otherwise you may get conflicting dual definitions.<br><br>If
the Pyrex module resides within a package, then:<br><ul><li>The
name of the header file contains of the full dotted name of the module.</li><li>The
name of the importing function contains the full name with dots
replaced by double underscores.</li></ul>E.g. a module
called <span style="font-weight: bold;">foo.spam</span>
would have an API header file called <span style="font-weight: bold;">foo.spam_api.h</span> and
an importing function called <span style="font-weight: bold;">import_foo__spam()</span>.<br><h3><a name="Multiple_public_and_api_declarations"></a>Multiple public and api declarations</h3>You can declare a whole group of items as <span style="font-style: italic;">public</span> and/or <span style="font-style: italic;">api</span> all at once by enclosing them in a cdef block, for example,<br><pre style="margin-left: 40px;">cdef public api:<br>    void order_spam(int tons)<br>    char *get_lunch(float tomato_size)<br></pre>This can be a useful thing to do in a <span style="font-family: monospace;">.pxd</span> file (see <a href="sharing.html">Sharing Declarations

provides facilities for releasing the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)
before calling C code, and for acquiring the GIL in functions that are
to be called back from C code that is executed without the GIL.<br><h3>Releasing the GIL</h3>You can release the GIL around a section of code using the<span style="font-family: monospace; font-weight: bold;"> with nogil </span>statement:<br><pre style="margin-left: 40px;">with nogil:<br>   &lt;code to be executed with the GIL released&gt;<br></pre>Code in the body of the statement <span style="font-style: italic;">must not manipulate Python objects</span>,
and must
not call anything that manipulates Python objects without first
re-acquiring the GIL. Pyrex attempts to check that these restrictions
are being followed as far as it can, but it may not catch all possible
forms of violation<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>.<br><br>Any external C functions called inside the block must be declared as <span style="font-family: monospace;">nogil</span> (<a href="#nogil">see below</a>).<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span>:
It may be safe to do some things with Python objects under some
circumstances. Provided steps are taken (such as adequate locking) to
ensure that the objects involved cannot be deallocated by Python code
running in another thread, it is probably safe to access non-Python C
attributes of an extension type, and to pass references to Python
objects to another function that is safe to call with the GIL released.<br><br>However, in the absence of such locking, it is not safe to do <span style="font-style: italic;">anything</span> with Python objects with the GIL released -- not even look at them.<br><h3>Acquiring the GIL</h3>A
